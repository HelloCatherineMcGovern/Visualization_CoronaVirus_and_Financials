Title: Dread and Community Spread the time of the Coronavirus.
Group: Ty Mitchell and Catherine McGovern

Introduction and Problem Statement
By now COVID 19 has affected almost every country on the planet, leaving no population or person untouched by its medical, governmental and economic impacts.

Although the effects of the disease are concrete, there are also considerable psychological impacts present that are more nebulous. Profound unemployment is indeed real, and likewise a population’s ensuing mental dread about the future. Nowhere is this more palpable in the arena of the stock market. 

For the past decade the Dow has experienced astounding growth, becoming the longest bull market the US has seen. Recently, in the midst of the pandemic, the market saw an end to an 11-year growth streak. And although ultimately economists predict that the resulting depression/recession would be short lived and forecast a robust recovery, stock brokers respond moment-to-moment to a variety of factors - at times acting with optimistic abandon when deaths rise, and at other times, with dread even though economic relief is coming to consumer or certain locales are succeeding with flattening the curve.

In summary our group seeks to explore the spread of the virus and its impact on financial markets via examination of various market indexes.

The Target Audience
The premise of our visualization and research is geared toward a college educated audience. However the conclusions contained there-in ultimately affect all working-age demographics. Our audience will already contain familiarity with at minimum basic stock market concepts. Many will be grappling with how the spread of the virus not only affects their current jobs, but their retirement savings in a variety of market products: stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds, traditional and Roth IRAs. Although most advisors will tell their clients to stay the course, recent sell-offs by high profile actors and professional brokers will give even the most steadfast investor pause: Consider this paragraph from a recent wall street journal article regarding the markets volatility: [W]hen things get wild, the computers at Crabel and other firms start selling—helping make it wilder still. “We need to cut position size when market volatility pops,” even if the positions seem like winners over the long term, said Mr. Pomada, Crabel’s chief executive. “It can feel awkward, but we know we’re doing the right thing from a risk perspective.” https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-markets-so-volatile-its-not-just-the-coronavirus-11584393165

Data Visualization Tools
A variety of visualization tools were employed to tell this story. The nature of the virus is more fully realized when viewed through a variety of lenses. The contagious nature of the virus and it’s long incubation period is most fully realizes via a line plot that marked the growth of confirmed cases over a period of weeks. Geographic charts show how the movement of people in our mobile society spreads the virus as well. Additionally with the inclusion of financial data via a variety of market indexes, one can see how the spread of the virus as well as activities to contain the virus are affecting the economy.
